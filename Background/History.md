# History About Git

## Linus Torvalds, the brilliant mind behind the Linux Kernel, had a profound vision for the evolution and collaboration of software development. In 2002, he initially chose Bitkeeper as the version control system for the Linux Kernel, offering an open environment for source code access and contributions. This decision allowed developers to freely modify and improve the kernel, fostering a vibrant community-driven development process.

## However, the open nature of Bitkeeper was short-lived due to licensing restrictions that limited access to the source code. This presented a challenge to Linus Torvalds's vision of open collaboration. Undeterred, he sought a solution that would align with his principles.

## In 2005, a significant milestone in the history of version control systems was reached when Linus Torvalds introduced Git. Git, a distributed version control system, revolutionized the way software development and version control were approached. By making Git an open source tool, Linus Torvalds ensured that the evolution of the Linux Kernel would continue unhindered. This decision also empowered a global community of developers to actively participate, share their expertise, and contribute to the success of the project.

## Linus Torvalds's embrace of Git as an open source solution marked a pivotal moment not only for the Linux Kernel but for the entire software development community. It solidified the foundation for a thriving ecosystem of developers, enabling efficient collaboration, innovation, and the widespread adoption of Linux across various industries.

## Through Git, Linus Torvalds's vision of an open and collaborative development process became a reality, leaving an indelible mark on the history of version control systems and reinforcing the power of open source software development.

# Features of Git

* Speed 
* Simple design
* Support for non-linear development
* Distributed
* Scalable

# Different between git and other vcs


## Git differs from other version control systems in that it captures snapshots of the entire file, whereas other systems focus on recording the differences between files. Git's approach involves taking comprehensive snapshots of the entire file, providing a holistic view of the project's state at different points in time, while alternative version control systems concentrate on tracking changes between files, storing only the modifications made.

# Installation Git

* On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```shell 
    apt-get install git
```
